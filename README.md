# ESM 206 Week 8 Coding Lesson

### Introduction to multiple linear regression

The examples in this lesson use the **penguins** data from the `palmerpenguins` package. See more information on the data and package here: https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/. Data were originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and colleagues with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research site.

**Required packages:**

The following packages are needed in this lesson: 

    - `tidyverse`
    - `palmerpenguins`
    - `GGally` (206 students: you probably need to install this one)
    - `broom`
    - `kableExtra`
    - `stargazer` (206 students: you probably need to install this one)
